# HRD-app
This is a handwritten digit recognition application developed using the Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). A CNN model has been developed and trained on datasets including the handwritten images of numerical digits from 0-9. It has been already trained and saved as "HDRmodel.h5". **Keras** library has been used to develop the neural network.

For the exeution, **Tkinter** library has been used to develop a GUI for the purpose of Digit Recognition but since Google Colaboratory does not support GUI implementation, so we have implemented the GUI seperately and saved the respective file as "project.py" which uses our pretrained HDR model.
